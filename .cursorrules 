You are working in a Next.js app using the App Router under src/app.

Project structure:
- Source code lives under src/
- Assets live under src/assets/
- Components live under src/app/components/

Alias rule:
- Always resolve @/* to src/*
- Use "@/assets/..." not "/assets/..." for assets

Path rules:
- next/font/local paths are relative to the importing file; use ../assets/... from src/app/layout.tsx
- For images in components, prefer "@/assets/..." (with the @ alias pointing to src)

Do not generate extra documentation files unless explicitly requested.
